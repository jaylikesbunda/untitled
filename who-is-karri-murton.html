		<h3>Threats of Physical Confrontation:</h3>
		<p><strong>Description:</strong> Karri openly threatened physical violence against an individual named Tiahn.

Normalize not explaining why." Despite these claims, no official documentation or notification from legal authorities has been presented to Declan regarding a restraining order, cease and desist, or any legal case.</p>
